# AutoML for Images with Azure ML

AutoML is an Azure Machine Learning feature, that empowers both professional and citizen data scientists to build machine learning models rapidly. Since its launch, AutoML has helped accelerate model building for essential machine learning tasks like Classification, Regression and Time-series Forecasting. 

With the preview of AutoML for Images, there will be added **support for Vision tasks**. Data scientists will be able to easily generate models trained on image data for scenarios like **Image Classification (multi-class, multi-label), Object Detection and Instance Segmentation.**

AutoML for Images is currently in Private Preview.
